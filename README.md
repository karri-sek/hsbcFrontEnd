### Enhancements

This frontend can be enhanced by displaying the city names, like the mention from the README from test.

At the moment this app used to get the city count whose name start with the letter entered by the user. I thought of displaying the city names as well, however I opted to the requirement mentioned on the README.md from the test. Please let me know, if this is not correct.
